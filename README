 This is an (extremely) simple plugin, which makes VIM Tab Page functions more user-friendly. 

 <> Features:
 1. ":E filename"			        Open the file in a new tab page instead of in current window.

 2. "<ALt-1>, <Alt-2> to <Alt-0>"	Switch to tab page 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10.

 3. "<Alt-h> / <Alt-l>"		        Switch to previous/next tab page.

 4. "<Alt-H> / <Alt-L>"		        Move current tab page left/right.

 5. Show GUI Tab Labels in format: "[Tab Number]:[+][Buffer Name]"
 	PS: [+] stands for one or more buffer in that tab page has been modified.

 <> Feedback:
    You are always encouraged to modify this plugin freely to suit your own needs!
