This is an (extremely) simple plugin, which makes VIM Tab Page functions more user-friendly. 

<> Features:
1. ":E %FILNAME%"			Open the file in a new tab instead of in current window.

2. "<Alt-H> / <Alt-L>"		Toggle current tab forward/backword.

3. "<ALt-1>, <Alt-2> to <Alt-0>"	Switch to tab 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10.

4. Show GUI Tab Labels in format: "[Tab Number]:[+][Buffer Name]"
	PS: [+] stands for one or more buffer in that tab has been modified.

<> Feedback:
     You are always encouraged to modify this plugin freely to suit your own needs!
